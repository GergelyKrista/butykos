# Known Bugs & Issues - Alcohol Empire Tycoon

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16
**Current Branch:** dev
**Phase:** Phase 5 Complete

---

## üö® Critical (Fix ASAP)
*Bugs that prevent development or break core gameplay*

- [ ] None currently

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority (Fix This Phase)
*Important bugs that affect gameplay but don't block development*

### Isometric Grid System
- [ ] **Temporary 45¬∞ rotation** - Current implementation rotates camera/world by 45¬∞ instead of true isometric coordinate conversion
  - **Impact:** Mouse input slightly imprecise, sprite artists need proper isometric specs
  - **Fix:** Implement proper cart_to_iso() and iso_to_cart() functions
  - **Planned:** Next development phase after Save/Load system
  - **File:** `systems/world_manager.gd`, `scenes/world_map/world_map.gd`

### Mouse Input
- [ ] **Mouse position offset in rotated view** - Click position doesn't perfectly match grid tile in isometric view
  - **Impact:** Placement feels slightly off, especially for larger facilities
  - **Fix:** Implement proper isometric mouse coordinate conversion
  - **Workaround:** Currently using rotated mouse position, good enough for testing
  - **File:** `scenes/world_map/world_map.gd` (_input function)

---

## üìã Medium Priority (Fix During Polish Phase)
*Issues that affect user experience but don't break functionality*

### Visual/UI Issues
- [ ] **Facility labels overlap** - When placing multiple facilities close together, their name labels clip through each other
  - **Impact:** Visual clutter, hard to read
  - **Fix:** Add label positioning logic or billboard sprites
  - **Phase:** Phase 7B (UI/UX Improvements)

- [ ] **Grid lines visibility** - Grid lines at 2.0 width and 0.8 opacity may be too visible/distracting
  - **Impact:** Visual polish
  - **Fix:** Adjust grid_color and grid_line_width in grid_renderer.gd, possibly add toggle
  - **Phase:** Phase 7C (Visual Polish)

- [ ] **Placement preview rotation** - Preview ghosts don't perfectly match final placement in isometric view
  - **Impact:** Slight mismatch between preview and actual placement
  - **Fix:** Update placement preview to use same coordinate conversion as actual placement
  - **Phase:** When fixing proper isometric grid

### Factory Interior
- [ ] **Machine labels missing** - Machines don't show their type/name when placed
  - **Impact:** Hard to identify machines at a glance
  - **Fix:** Add Label nodes to machine nodes (similar to facilities)
  - **Phase:** Phase 7B (UI/UX Improvements)

- [ ] **Connection lines overlap** - Multiple connection lines between machines can overlap and obscure each other
  - **Impact:** Visual clarity in complex factory layouts
  - **Fix:** Add line offset logic or connection bundling
  - **Phase:** Phase 7B (UI/UX Improvements)

### World Map
- [ ] **Camera zoom limits** - Camera can zoom too far in/out, causing visual issues
  - **Impact:** Can lose orientation or see rendering artifacts
  - **Fix:** Add min/max zoom constraints to camera_controller.gd
  - **Phase:** Phase 7B (UI/UX Improvements)

## üîß Low Priority (Fix If Time)
*Nice-to-have fixes that don't significantly impact gameplay*

### Performance
- [ ] **Untested at scale** - Not tested with 50+ facilities and 100+ vehicles
  - **Impact:** Unknown performance characteristics at full scale
  - **Fix:** Performance profiling and optimization pass
  - **Phase:** Phase 7 (Polish) or when performance issues arise

### Visual Polish
- [ ] **Route lines are straight** - Routes between facilities use straight lines instead of curves
  - **Impact:** Visual aesthetic
  - **Fix:** Implement bezier curves for route rendering
  - **Phase:** Phase 7C (Visual Polish)

- [ ] **No production animations** - Facilities don't show visual feedback when producing
  - **Impact:** Game feels static
  - **Fix:** Add particle effects, smoke stacks, activity indicators
  - **Phase:** Phase 7C (Visual Polish)

- [ ] **Vehicle sprites are placeholders** - Yellow rectangles instead of truck sprites
  - **Impact:** Visual polish
  - **Fix:** Replace with proper vehicle sprites when artist provides them
  - **Phase:** Phase 7C (Visual Polish) / Ongoing

### UX Improvements
- [ ] **No facility tooltips** - Hovering over facilities doesn't show information
  - **Impact:** Hard to see facility stats without clicking
  - **Fix:** Add tooltip system with facility info on hover
  - **Phase:** Phase 7B (UI/UX Improvements)

- [ ] **No route management UI** - Can't pause, delete, or view stats for routes
  - **Impact:** Limited logistics control
  - **Fix:** Add route list panel with controls
  - **Phase:** Phase 7B (UI/UX Improvements)

## ‚úÖ Won't Fix (By Design / Planned Features)
*Issues that are intentional limitations or planned features for later phases*

### Incomplete Systems
- **No save/load functionality** - SaveManager framework exists but not implemented
  - **Status:** Planned for Phase 7A (next major development phase)
  - **Impact:** Can't persist progress between sessions
  - **File:** `core/save_manager.gd`

- **Static product pricing** - All products have fixed prices, no supply/demand
  - **Status:** Planned for Phase 6A (Market System)
  - **Impact:** Limited economic gameplay
  - **File:** `systems/production_manager.gd`

- **No tutorial/onboarding** - New players have to figure out mechanics themselves
  - **Status:** Planned for Phase 7D (Tutorial & Progression)
  - **Impact:** Steep learning curve

- **No multi-input recipes** - All production only uses single input type
  - **Status:** Optional Phase 5C, may be added later
  - **Impact:** Limited production complexity
  - **File:** `data/recipes.json` (currently empty)

- **No facility upgrades** - Can't improve existing facilities
  - **Status:** Planned for Phase 6B (Upgrades & Research)
  - **Impact:** Limited progression mechanics

- **No AI competition** - Player has monopoly on all markets
  - **Status:** Planned for Phase 9A (Competition & Markets)
  - **Impact:** No competitive pressure

### Design Decisions
- **Manual machine connections** - Not adjacency-based automatic connections
  - **Status:** Intentional design choice for player control
  - **Reasoning:** Gives players precise control over production flow

- **Per-machine inventory** - Machines don't share facility inventory pool
  - **Status:** Intentional design choice
  - **Reasoning:** Allows buffer management and complex logistics

- **Factory interiors are top-down** - Not isometric like world map
  - **Status:** Intentional design choice
  - **Reasoning:** Easier machine placement and clearer spatial understanding
