# Reusable Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts and reusable components.

## Structure

- `components/` - Behavior components (e.g., Draggable, Selectable)
- `ui_components/` - UI-specific scripts (e.g., Tooltip, InfoPanel)

## Usage

These scripts are attached to nodes as needed and provide modular functionality.
Prefer composition over inheritance for flexible scene design.
